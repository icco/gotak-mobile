# Gotak Mobile

This is a React Native application built with Expo that creates iOS and Android apps for playing Tak, the beautiful board game.

## About Tak

Tak is a two-player board game where you build roads of stones to connect opposite sides of the board. The game uses two colors of pieces similar to checkers or Go. Learn more about the rules at [US Tak Association](https://ustak.org/play-beautiful-game-tak/).

## Backend Integration

The backend service is at https://github.com/icco/gotak, with API documentation at https://gotak.app/swagger/doc.json.

## Troubleshooting

### 404 Error when Creating New Game

If you encounter a 404 error when trying to create a new game, this usually means the backend server is not running or not accessible. Here are some steps to debug:

1. **Check the API URL**: The app is configured to use `https://gotak.app` by default. You can override this by setting the `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable.

2. **Test the server**: The app now includes connection testing. Check the console logs for detailed error information.

3. **Local development**: If you're running the backend locally, set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```

4. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure your device/emulator has internet access.

5. **View detailed logs**: The app now logs detailed information about API requests. Check the console for:
   - Connection test results
   - Request URLs being called
   - Response status codes and data

### Common Issues

- **Network timeout**: The app has a 10-second timeout for API requests
- **CORS issues**: If running locally, ensure your backend allows requests from your development environment
- **SSL certificate issues**: Some Android emulators may have issues with HTTPS certificates
